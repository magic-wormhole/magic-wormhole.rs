# Rusty Wormhole

Get things from one computer to another, safely.

<http://magic-wormhole.io/>

This is a Rust port of the Python version at <https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole>.

## This is a work in progress

As of version `0.1.0`, most of the major protocols are implemented. The library part can be deemed "usable", although the API is far away from being "stable". There is still a lot of work to be done here, notably error handling and code documentation.

The CLI is in a "proof of concept" state at the moment. Basic file sending and receiving is implemented, but everything else is missing. Note that this is not a 1:1 port of the Python CLI; and it won't be a drop-in replacement for it.

## Getting started

If you want to toy with the CLI, `cargo run -- --help` will get you started. The code sits in `./src/bin`.

If you'd like to use Wormhole in your application, `cargo doc --open` will tell you how to use it. There aren't any hosted docs at the moment.

If you don't fear touching code and want to contribute, `./src/lib.rs`, `./src/transfer.rs` and `./src/transit.rs` are rather easy to get into.

However before diving into the `core` module, you should definitively read the [spec](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [implementation notes](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole.rs/wiki) first. Maybe having a bit of understanding of the Python implementation doesn't hurt either.
